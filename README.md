# Startest

A tiny yet flexible test runner inspired by [libsdust's](https://github.com/d-sdust/libsdust) `test.py`.

## Usage

First, install `test.py` somewhere. You can even include it right in your project's folder, 
it does not actually make sense.

Then, in root of your project, create a file named `tests.toml` with
the schema from `tests.toml` from this repo.

After you included your tests, just run the runner you installed
in step one!

See `test.py --help` for available options.
